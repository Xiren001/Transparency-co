# Contact Form Email Setup Guide

## Current Status âœ…

The contact form is now fully functional and will send emails to **michael@topshelf.life** when submitted.

Currently, the application is configured to **log emails** instead of sending them (perfect for development/testing). You can find logged emails in `storage/logs/laravel.log`.

## Components Created

### Backend Components:

1. **ContactController** - Handles form submissions and sends emails
2. **ContactFormRequest** - Validates form input with custom error messages
3. **ContactFormSubmitted** - Email notification class
4. **Email Template** - Beautiful HTML email template at `resources/views/emails/contact-form.blade.php`
5. **Routes** - GET and POST routes for `/contact`

### Frontend Updates:

- Updated contact form to submit data to backend
- Added proper error handling and validation display
- Real-time error clearing when user types
- Success/error message display

## Email Configuration for Production

When you're ready to send actual emails, you'll need to:

### Option 1: SMTP (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)

Add these to your `.env` file:

```env
MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
MAIL_PORT=587
MAIL_USERNAME=your-email@gmail.com
MAIL_PASSWORD=your-app-password
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=tls
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=your-email@gmail.com
MAIL_FROM_NAME="Transparency Co."
```

### Option 2: Postmark (Recommended for production)

```env
MAIL_MAILER=postmark
POSTMARK_TOKEN=your-postmark-token
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=noreply@yourdomain.com
MAIL_FROM_NAME="Transparency Co."
```

### Option 3: Resend

```env
MAIL_MAILER=resend
RESEND_KEY=your-resend-api-key
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=noreply@yourdomain.com
MAIL_FROM_NAME="Transparency Co."
```

## Testing

### Development Testing

1. Submit the contact form
2. Check `storage/logs/laravel.log` for the email content
3. Look for entries like: `[timestamp] local.INFO: Mail message sent`

### Production Testing

1. Configure your preferred email service
2. Submit a test message
3. Check that michael@topshelf.life receives the email
